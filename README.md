# EventVibe
The Event Management System is a web-based platform designed to simplify event planning and organization. Event planners can register on the website and post details about a wide range of events, including weddings, birthday parties, trade shows, and more. Users can discover these events and choose from different packages offered by event planners, enhancing their event experience. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for the back-end, and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage. It provides a user-friendly interface for both event planners and users to interact with, allowing for event posting, searching, and package selection. This project aims to streamline the event planning process, making it easy for users to find and customize their events while helping event planners reach a wider audience.
